## :wave: Intros!

A simple To-Do list web app to log your daily task, with a hidden feature that allow users to build unlimited list with their own custom list name on-the-fly. Built with Express and Mongoose, an elegant schema-based solution to model application data with the MongoDB database on the server-side.

The live website is deployed through Heroku and feel free to check it out [here](https://salty-hamlet-84531.herokuapp.com/ "To-Do List")! This project is meant for learning and practice working with backend technologies such as Express and MongoDB, hence the client side and its functionality are kept to a bare minumum. Nevertheless, feedbacks are always highly valued 😇

## :pushpin: Objectives

* Create a minimalistic To-Do list page that allow users to add any number of task(s) to the list.

* Utiltize a database platform that talks to the application so it can persist data whenever users add items to their list. 

* Provide users with the option to create any number of To-Do lists with their own custom list name.

* Deploy the database to MongoDB Atlas and the web app using a PaaS such as Heroku, etc.

**Notes:**

**_MongoDB with Mongoose was chosen for this project database in an effort to learn more and gain a better understanding of its platform and how NoSQL work in relation to PostgreSQL_**

**_Custom lists creation is available through simply typing a list name of your choice in the URL of the homepage. i.e, 'https://salty-hamlet-84531.herokuapp.com/app-ideas' - Replace "app-ideas" with any name you wish for your list and it generate a brand new list that's seperate from the homepage list._**
